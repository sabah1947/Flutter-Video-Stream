# Retrieves a List of Video and Displays it. 
Created a flutter application with the following features:
 - Uses youtube v3 Data API to extract videos using url
 - Created json object to display in the app widget
 - Lists a number of videos of a particular channel and can be adjusted as per requirement.
 - Assumptions : The videos is taken from the streaming service youtube.
	       : The list is extracted from a channel. Rather than a fixed list of videos.
